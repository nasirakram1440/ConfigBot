*            What is ConfigBot            *
===========================================

Lets say you want to make some configuration changes to a router or switch at a specific time and date. Traditionally you would have to login to that device and enter the commands on the command prompt. Using ConfigBot you can save all your configuration commands in a file and ConfigBot will read your commands and run it on a device at a time and date you specify.

To get started, copy the project files to your linux machines home directory and run ./ConfigBot/ConfigBot.sh
